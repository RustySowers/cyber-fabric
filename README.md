# "cyber-fabrica"

# Cyber is "cyber" in Latin
# Device is "fabrica" in Latin

# The purpose of this project:
# -generate an exhaustive list of network-capable device/system types by each system's functionality
# -utilize known expsorue criteria to "grade" a system's exposure factors
# -for entity or security function to utilize a risk model to enable rapid identification of risk based on general or acute awareness of system-types owned, 
   utilized, etc
# -for entity or security function to rapidly generate current-state exposure rating based on systems owned or utilized and their related exposure criteria and 
   factors

# 1. Entity generates list of system or device types
# 2. Entity assigns exposure criteria and factors to system list 
# 3. Entity analyzes system list's exposure factors and prioritizes per organization's objectives
# 4. Entity adjusts current practices to address exposures   
#  Optional: Entity compares prioritization to other risk identification
