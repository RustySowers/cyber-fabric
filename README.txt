Purpose of the Network-Enabled Systems List? Many hardware types are used in specific use cases, but current IT and security aren't always allowed or able to "see" via network scan, and they likely do not label to the granularity of a function or use-specific and uniform label

Usage examples for list?
1. Identify potential areas or device categories known to exist but yet a focus to the level of review, test, TM, etc
2. Compare system-type exposure factors to current organizational measurements relating to risk, cyber, etc
3. Decision point to rate exposure while comparing two or more classes of devices (e.g., Comparing Thin Client vs. Thick Client vs. Desktop PC as part of a    
   technology purchase)
4. A security testing path for bare-metal network systems with an intended use, since many systems are a base hardware product with function-specific software 
5. Align labels with asset inventory and add exposure factors to risk formulas
5. Cybersecurity industry drafts criteria for system exposure rating
6. Cybersecurity industry assigns exposure factor to system
7. TBC



Rate exposure factors, compare to hardware list risks

-generate an exhaustive list of network-capable device/system types by each system's functionality
-utilize known expsorue criteria to "grade" a system's exposure factors
-for entity or security function to utilize a risk model to enable rapid identification of risk based on general or acute awareness of system-types owned, 
   utilized, etc
-for entity or security function to rapidly generate current-state exposure rating based on systems owned or utilized and their related exposure criteria and 
   factors




 1. Entity generates list of system or device types
 2. Entity assigns exposure criteria and factors to system list 
 3. Entity analyzes system list's exposure factors and prioritizes per organization's objectives
 4. Entity adjusts current practices to address exposures   
  Optional: Entity compares prioritization to other risk identification
